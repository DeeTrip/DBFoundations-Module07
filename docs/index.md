# SQL Functions

## Introduction
**SQL functions** are simply sub-programs, which are commonly used and re-used throughout SQL database applications for processing or manipulating data. Basically, it is a **set of SQL statements that accept only input parameters, perform actions and return the result**. The function can return only a single value or a table. We can't use a function to Insert, Update, Delete records in the database table(s).

Functions **foster code reusability**. If there is need to repeatedly write large SQL scripts to perform the same task, then we can create a function that performs that task. Next time instead of rewriting the SQL, specific function can be called.
The basic CREATE FUNCTION syntax is as follows â€“
